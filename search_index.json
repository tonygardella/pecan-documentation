["project-overview.html", "Project Overview", " Project Overview The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) is an integrated informatics toolbox for ecosystem modeling (Dietze et al. 2013, LeBauer et al. 2013). PEcAn consists of: An application program interface (API) that encapsulates an ecosystem model, providing a common interface, inputs, and output. Core utilities for handling and tracking model runs and the flows of information and uncertainties into and out of models and analyses An accessible web-based user interface and visualization tools An extensible collection of modules to handle specific types of analyses (sensitivity, uncertainty, ensemble), model-data syntheses (benchmarking, parameter data assimilation, state data assimilation), and data processing (model inputs and data constraints) This project is motivated by the fact that many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data and strategically prioritize the collection of new data. This project seeks to improve this ability by developing a framework for integrating multiple data sources in a sensible manner. The workflow system allows ecosystem modeling to be more reproducible, automated, and transparent in terms of operations applied to data, and thus ultimately more comprehensible to both peers and the public. It reduces the redundancy of effort among modeling groups, facilitate collaboration, and make models more accessible the rest of the research community. PEcAn is not itself an ecosystem model, and it can be used to with a variety of different ecosystem models; integrating a model involves writing a wrapper to convert inputs and outputs to and from the standards used by PEcAn. Currently, PEcAn supports multiple models listed PEcAn Models.

["getting-started.html", "2 Getting Started 2.1 How PEcAn Works in a nutshell 2.2 Quick Start", " 2 Getting Started 2.1 How PEcAn Works in a nutshell PEcAn provides an interface to a variety of ecosystem models and attempts to standardize and automate the processes of model parameterization, execution, and analysis. First, you choose an ecosystem model, then the time and location of interest (a site), the plant community (or crop) that you are interested in simulating, and a source of atmospheric data from the BETY database (LeBauer et al, 2010). These are set in a “settings” file, commonly named pecan.xml which can be edited manually if desired. From here, PEcAn will take over and set up and execute the selected model using your settings. The key is that PEcAn uses models as-is, and all of the translation steps are done within PEcAn so no modifications are required of the model itself. Once the model is finished it will allow you to create graphs with the results of the simulation as well as download the results. It is also possible to see all past experiments and simulations. 2.2 Quick Start There are two ways of using PEcAn, via the web interface and directly within R. Even for users familiar with R, using the web interface is a good place to start because it provides a high level overview of the PEcAn workflow.The quickest way to get started is to download the virtual machine or use an AWS instance. 2.2.1 Working with the PEcAn VM PEcAn consists of a set of scripts and code that is compiled within a Linux operating system and saved in a “virtual machine (VM)”. Virtual machines allow for running consistent set-ups without worrying about differences between operating systems, library dependencies, compiling the code, etc. To run the PEcAn VM you will need to install VirtualBox, the program that runs the virtual machine http://www.virtualbox.org. On Windows you may see a warning about Logo testing, it is okay to ignore the warning. After you have Virtual Box installed you’ll need to download the PEcAn virtual machine: http://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/projects/artifacts.php?key=PECAN. The virtual machine is available under the “Files” header. Click the 32 or 64 bit “.ova” file and note that the download is ~5 GB so will take from several minutes to hours depending on the connection speed. To open up the virtual machine you’ll first want to open up VirtualBox. The first time you use the VM you’ll want to use File → Import Appliance in VirtualBox in order to import the VM. This will create a virtual machine from the disk image. When asked about the Appliance Import Settings make sure you select “Reinitialize the MAC address of all network cards”. This is not selected by default and can result in networking issues since multiple machines might claim to have the same network MAC Address. That said, users who have experienced network connection difficulties within the VM have sometimes had better luck after reinstalling without reinitializing. 6. Next, click “Import”. You only have to do this Import step once, in the future you can just skip to the next step. Start Pecan by double clicking on the icon for the VM. A terminal window will pop up showing the machine booting up which may take a minute. It is done booting when you get to the “pecan32 login:” prompt. You do not need to login as the VM behaves like a server that we will be accessing through you web browser. Feel free to minimize the VM window. 2.2.2 Using AmazonWeb Services (AWS) Login to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and select the EC2 Dashboard. If this is your first time using AWS you will need to set up an account before you are able to access the EC2 Dashboard. Important: You will need a credit card number and access to a phone to be able to verify AWS account registration. AWS is free for one year. Choose AMI On the top right next to your name, make sure the location setting is on U.S. East (N. Virginia), not U.S. West (Oregon) On the left click, click on EC2 (Virtual servers), then click on “AMIs”, also on the left In the search window toggle to change “Owned by me” to “Public images” Type “pecan” into the search window Click on the toggle button on the left next to PEcAn1.4.6 Click on the “Launch” button at the top Choose an Instance Type Select what type of machine you want to run. For this demo the default, t2.micro, will be adequate. Be aware that different machine types incur very different costs, from 1.3 cents/hour to over $5/hr https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ Select t2.micro, then click “Next: Configure Instance Details” Configure Instance Details The defaults are OK. Click “Next: Add Storage” Add Storage The defaults are OK. Click “Next: Tag Instance” Tag Instance You can name your instance if you want. Click “Next: Configure Security Group” Configure Security Group You will need to add two new rules: Click “Add Rule” then select “HTTP” from the pull down menu. This rule allows you to access the webserver on PEcAn. Click “Add Rule”, leave the pull down on “Custom TCP Rule”, and then change the Port Range from 0 to 8787. Set “Source” to Anywhere. This rule allows you to access RStudio Server on PEcAn. Click “Review and Launch” . You will then see this pop-up: Select the default drive volume type and click Next Review and Launch Review the settings and then click “Launch”, which will pop up a select/create Key Pair window. Key Pair Select “Create a new key pair” and give it a name. You won’t actually need this key unless you need to SSH into your PEcAn server, but AWS requires you to create one. Click on “Download Key Pair” then on “Launch Instances”. Next click on “View Instances” at the bottom of the following page. Instances You will see the status of your PEcAn VM, which will take a minute to boot up. Wait until the Instance State reads “running”. The most important piece of information here is the Public IP, which is the URL you will need in order to access your PEcAn instance from within your web browser (see Demo 1 below). Be aware that it often takes ~1 hr for AWS instances to become fully operational, so if you get an error when you put the Public IP in you web browser, most of the time you just need to wait a bit longer. Congratulations! You just started a PEcAn server in the “cloud”! When you are done using PEcAn, you will want to return to the “Instances” menu to turn off your VM. To STOP the instance (which will turn the machine off but keep your work), select your PEcAn instance and click Actions &gt; Instance state &gt; Stop. Be aware that a stopped instance will still accrue a small storage cost on AWS. To restart this instance at any point in the future you do not want to repeat all the steps above, but instead you just need to select your instance and then click Actions &gt; Instance state &gt; Start To TERMINATE the instance (which will DELETE your PEcAn machine), select your instance and click Actions &gt; Instance state &gt; Terminate. Terminated instances will not incur costs. In most cases you will also want to go to the Volumes menu and delete the storage associated with your PEcAn VM.Remember, AWS is free for one year, but will automatically charge a fee in second year if account is not cancelled.

["using-browndog.html", "5 Using Browndog 5.1 PEcAn XML Configuration", " 5 Using Browndog 5.1 PEcAn XML Configuration The PEcAn system is configured using a xml file, often called settings.xml. The configuration file can be split in X seperate pieces: PEcAn Folders Database Access BETY Configuration Brown Dog PFT Selection Meta Analysis Ensemble Runs Sensitivity Runs Model Setup Run Setup State Data Assimilation 5.1.1 PEcAn folders The following are the tags that can be used to configure the folders used by PEcAn. All of these are optional. &lt;outdir&gt;/home/carya/testrun.pecan&lt;/outdir&gt; outdir : [optional] specifies where PEcAn will write all outputs and create folders. If this is not specified the folder pecan in the current folder will be used. 5.1.2 Database Access The connection to the BETY database is configured using this section. In this section you will specify what driver to use to connect to the database (PostgreSQL by default) and the connection parameters to connect to the database. This section is very picky and will only accept parameters that are passed into the connection function for each database driver, any other entries will result in an error by the database driver. 5.1.2.1 functions: db.open(), and thus by db.query() and db.check(). New format (starting with PEcAn 1.3.6) &lt;database&gt; &lt;bety&gt; &lt;dbname&gt;bety&lt;/dbname&gt; &lt;username&gt;bety&lt;/username&gt; &lt;password&gt;bety&lt;/password&gt; &lt;host&gt;localhost&lt;/host&gt; &lt;write&gt;true&lt;/write&gt; &lt;/bety&gt; &lt;fia&gt; &lt;dbname&gt;fia5data&lt;/dbname&gt; &lt;username&gt;bety&lt;/username&gt; &lt;password&gt;bety&lt;/password&gt; &lt;host&gt;localhost&lt;/host&gt; &lt;/fia&gt; &lt;/database&gt; The connection information under bety will be used by most of the PEcAn system, only the extraction of pss/css/site information from the FIA database will use the connection information in the fia section. driver : [optional] the driver to use to connect to the database. Default value is PostgreSQL dbname : [optional] the name of the database (was name), default value is the username of the current user logged in. user : [optional] the username to connect to the database (was userid), default value is the username of the current user logged in (PostgreSQL uses user for this field). password : [optional] the password to connect to the database (was passwd), if not specified no password is used. host : [optional] the name of the host to connect to, default value is localhost. write : [optional] should any results be written back to the database, setting this to TRUE (the default) will write any results back into the database. (since PEcAn 1.3.6) For other database drivers these parameters will change. See the driver documentation in R for the right parameters. 5.1.3 BETY Database Configuration This section describes how to connect to the BETY Database. This section is used for versions of PEcAn prior to version 1.3.6, starting at 1.3.6 this parameter is part of &lt;database&gt;&lt;bety&gt; and defaults to TRUE. 5.1.3.1 functions: db.check(), write.configs(), run.models() &lt;bety&gt; &lt;write&gt;TRUE&lt;/write&gt; &lt;/bety&gt; write : [optional] this can be TRUE/FALSE (the default is TRUE). If set to TRUE, runs, ensembles and workflows are written to the database. 5.1.4 Brown Dog Configuration This section describes how to connect to Brown Dog. This will allow for conversions of data (currently only met data). 5.1.4.1 functions: met.process() &lt;browndog&gt; &lt;url&gt;...&lt;/url&gt; &lt;username&gt;...&lt;/username&gt; &lt;password&gt;...&lt;/password&gt; &lt;/browndog&gt; url : [required] endpoint for Brown Dog to be used. username : [optional] username to be used with the endpoint for Brown Dog. password : [optional] password to be used with the endpoint for Brown Dog. 5.1.5 PFT Selection The PEcAn system requires at least 1 PFT (Plant Functional Type) to be specified inside the &lt;pfts&gt; section. 5.1.5.1 functions: get.traits() 5.1.6 PFT tags &lt;pfts&gt; &lt;pft&gt; &lt;name&gt;sipnet.temperate.coniferous&lt;/name&gt; &lt;outdir&gt;/home/carya/testrun.pecan/pft/1/&lt;/outdir&gt; &lt;constants&gt; &lt;num&gt;1&lt;/num&gt; &lt;/constants&gt; &lt;/pft&gt; &lt;/pfts&gt; name : [required] the pft as is found inside the BETY database, this needs to be an exact match. outdir: [optional] path in which pft-specific output will be placed during meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis. If not specified it will be written into &lt;outdir&gt;/&lt;pftname&gt;. contants: [optional] this section contains information that will be written directly into the model specific configuration files. PEcAn does not look at the information in this section. 5.1.7 Meta Analysis 5.1.7.1 meta analysis functions: run.meta.analysis() 5.1.7.2 meta analysis tags &lt;meta.analysis&gt; &lt;iter&gt;1000&lt;/iter&gt; &lt;random.effects&gt;FALSE&lt;/random.effects&gt; &lt;update&gt;FALSE&lt;/update&gt; &lt;threshold&gt;1.2&lt;/threshold&gt; &lt;/meta.analysis&gt; The section meta.analysis needs to exists for a meta.analysis to be executed, even though all tags inside are optional. iter : [optional] [MCMC](http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) chain length, i.e. the total number of posterior samples in the meta-analysis, default is 3000. Smaller numbers will run faster but produce larger errors. random.effects : [optional] Whether to include random effects (site, treatment) in meta-analysis model. Can be set to FALSE to work around convergence problems caused by an over parameterized model (e.g. too many sites, not enough data). The default value is TRUE. update : [optional] Should previous results of meta.analysis and get.traits be re-used. If set to TRUE the meta-analysis and get.trait.data will always be executed. Setting this to FALSE will try and reuse existing results. Future versions will allow for AUTO as well which will try and reuse if the PFT/traits have not changed. The default value is FALSE. threshold threshold for Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic (MGPRF); default is 1.2 5.1.8 Ensemble Runs Only if this section is defined an ensemble analysis is done. 5.1.8.1 ensemble functions: write.configs(), run.ensemble.analysis() 5.1.8.2 ensemble tags &lt;ensemble&gt; &lt;size&gt;5&lt;/size&gt; &lt;variable&gt;GPP&lt;/variable&gt; &lt;variable&gt;NPP&lt;/variable&gt; &lt;/ensemble&gt; size : [required] the number of runs in the ensemble. variable: [optional] name of one (or more) variables the analysis should be run for. If not specified, sensitivity.analysis variable is used, otherwise default is GPP. Note: if the ensemble size is set to 1, PEcAn will select the posterior median parameter values rather than taking a single random draw from the posterior 5.1.9 Sensitivity Runs Only if this section is defined a sensitivity analysis is done. This section will have &lt;quantile&gt; or &lt;sigma&gt; nodes. If neither are given, the default is to use the median +/- [1 2 3] x sigma (e.g. the 0.00135 0.0228 0.159 0.5 0.841 0.977 0.999 quantiles); If the 0.5 (median) quantile is omitted, it will be added in the code. 5.1.9.1 functions: write.configs(), run.sensitivity.analysis() 5.1.9.2 sensitivity analysis tags &lt;sensitivity.analysis&gt; &lt;quantiles&gt; &lt;quantile&gt;&lt;/quantile&gt; &lt;sigma&gt;-3&lt;/sigma&gt; &lt;sigma&gt;-2&lt;/sigma&gt; &lt;sigma&gt;-1&lt;/sigma&gt; &lt;sigma&gt;1&lt;/sigma&gt; &lt;sigma&gt;2&lt;/sigma&gt; &lt;sigma&gt;3&lt;/sigma&gt; &lt;/quantiles&gt; &lt;variable&gt;GPP&lt;/variable&gt; &lt;start.year&gt;2004&lt;/start.year&gt; &lt;end.year&gt;2006&lt;/end.year&gt; &lt;/sensitivity.analysis&gt; quantiles : [optional] Quantiles of parameter distributions at which the model should be evaluated when running sensitivity analysis. Values greater than 0 and less than 1 can be used. sigma : [optional] Any real number can be used to indicate the quantiles to be used in units of normal probability. quantile : [optional] Which quantile should be used. start.date : [required?] start date of the sensitivity analysis (in YYYY/MM/DD format) end.date : [required?] end date of the sensitivity analysis (in YYYY/MM/DD format) NOTE: start.date and end.date are distinct from values set in the run tag because this analysis can be done over a subset of the run. ** variable** : [optional] name of one (or more) variables the analysis should be run for. If not specified, sensitivity.analysis variable is used, otherwise default is GPP. 5.1.10 Model Setup This section is required and tells PEcAn what model to run. This section should either specify &lt;id&gt; or both &lt;name&gt; and &lt;binary&gt; of the model. If both id and name and/or binary are specified the id is used to check the specified name and/or binary. As of version 1.3.7 the &lt;name&gt; tag has been renamed &lt;type&gt;. The &lt;type&gt; tag refers to the “type” of model and is used for a) identifying appropriate pfts and b) identifying whether appropriate inputs (i.e. met data) are available for the given site and model (or if they can be created). To ensure compatability, the code will automatically convert from &lt;name&gt; to &lt;type&gt;. 5.1.10.1 functions: write.configs(), run.models() 5.1.10.2 model tags &lt;model&gt; &lt;id&gt;7&lt;/id&gt; &lt;type&gt;ED2&lt;/type&gt; &lt;binary&gt;/usr/local/bin/ed2.r82&lt;/binary&gt; &lt;job.sh&gt;module load hdf5&lt;/job.sh&gt; &lt;config.header&gt; &lt;!--...xml code passed directly to config file...--&gt; &lt;/config.header&gt; &lt;/model&gt; id : [optional/required] id in the models database table, see above. name : OBSOLETE name of the model, use type from version 1.3.7 type : [optional/required] type of model, see above. binary : [optional/required] path to the model executable, see above. job.sh : [optional] additional options to add to the job.sh at the top config.headers : [optional] XML that will appear at the start of generated config files. 5.1.11 ED2 specific tags Following variables are ED specific and are used in the ED2 Configuration. Starting at 1.3.7 the tags for inputs have moved to &lt;run&gt;&lt;inputs&gt;.

Each model has it’s own template in the inst folder of the module. The following variables can e used: @SITE_LAT@, @SITE_LON@, @SITE_MET@, @START_DATE@, @END_DATE@, @OUTDIR@, @RUNDIR@ which all come variables in the pecan.xml file. The following two command can be used to copy and clean the results from a scratch folder (specified as scratch in the run section below, for example local disk vs network disk) : @SCRATCH_COPY@, @SCRATCH_CLEAR@ . start.date : [required] the first day of the simulation end.date : [required] the last day of the simulation dbfiles : [optional] location where pecan should write files that will be stored in the database. The default is store them in ${HOME}/.pecan/dbfiles Site specific information is specified in the &lt;site&gt; subsection. Either &lt;id&gt; or &lt;name&gt;, &lt;lat&gt; and &lt;lon&gt; should be specified. If id and any of the others are specified the values will be compared with those from BETYdb. id : [optional/required] id of the site in the BETY database, see above. name : [optional/required] site name, see above. lat : [optional/required] site latitude, see above. lon : [optional/required] site longitude, see above. Inputs specific information for each model type is specified in the &lt;inputs&gt; subsection. Each input will have three tags: * id : [optional/required] An id that points to the input if already in the database. * path : [optional/required] The path to the dataset if already downloaded. * source : [optional/required] The input data type. This tag name needs to match the names in the conversion functions. In general, the path should be filled in by PEcAn and not by the user. If PEcAn is processing all the input, id is not required. Alternatively, if you’re using data processed by hand, source is not required. One common input will be the weather data, often specified in &lt;met&gt;. Other model types will have different model specific inputs. PEcAn will find the location of the file on the host you run PEcAn on. met : [model type specific] most models will have a met tag to specify location of the weather data. pss : [ED2, required] location of patch file css : [ED2, required] location of cohort file site : [ED2, optional] location of site file lu : [ED2, required] location of land use file thsums : [ED2, required] location of thermal sums file veg : [ED2, required] location of vegetation data soil : [ED2, required] location of soil data Host on which the simulation will run is specified in the &lt;host&gt; subsection. If this section is not specified it is assumed the simulation will run on localhost. If qsub is specified (can be empty in which case the defaults will be used) the models will be executed using qsub. name : [optional] name of host server where model is located and executed, if not specified localhost is assumed. rundir : [optional/required] location where all the configuration files are written. For localhost this is optional (&lt;outdir&gt;/run is the default), for any other host this is required. outdir : [optional/required] location where all the outputs of the model are written. For localhost this is optional (&lt;outdir&gt;/out is the default), for any other host this is required. scratchdir : [optional] location where output is written. If specified the output from the model is written to this folder and copied to the outdir when the model is finished, this could significantly speed up the model execution (by using local or ram disk). clearscratch : [optional] if set to TRUE the scratchfolder is cleaned up after copying the results to the outdir, otherwise the folder will be left. The default is to clean up after copying. qsub : [optional] the command to submit a job to the queuing system. There are 3 parameters you can use when specifying the qsub command, you can add additional values for your specific setup (for example -l walltime to specify the walltime, etc). You can specify @NAME@ the pretty name, @STDOUT@ where to write stdout and @STDERR@, where to write stderr. You can specify an empty element () in which case it will use the default value is “qsub -V -N @NAME@ -o @STDOUT@ -e @STDERR@ -s /bin/bash”. qsub.jobid : [optional] the regular expression used to find the jobid returned from qsub. If not specified (and qsub is) it will use the default value is “Your job ([0-9]+) .*&quot; qstat : [optional] the command to execute to check if a job is finished, this should return DONE if the job is finished. There is one parameter this command should take @JOBID@ which is the id of the job as returned by qsub.jobid. If not specified (and qsub is) it will use the default value is “qstat -j @JOBID@ || echo DONE” job.sh : [optional] additional options to add to the job.sh at the top 5.1.13 State Data Assimilation Tags The following tags can be used for state data assimilation. More detailed information can be found here: State Data Assimilation Documentation &lt;state.data.assimilation&gt; &lt;process.variance&gt;FALSE&lt;/process.variance&gt; &lt;sample.parameters&gt;FALSE&lt;/sample.parameters&gt; &lt;state.variables&gt; &lt;variable&gt;AGB.pft&lt;/variable&gt; &lt;variable&gt;TotSoilCarb&lt;/variable&gt; &lt;/state.variables&gt; &lt;spin.up&gt; &lt;start.date&gt;2004/01/01&lt;/start.date&gt; &lt;end.date&gt;2006/12/31&lt;/end.date&gt; &lt;/spin.up&gt; &lt;forecast.time.step&gt;1&lt;/forecast.time.step&gt; &lt;start.date&gt;2004/01/01&lt;/start.date&gt; &lt;end.date&gt;2006/12/31&lt;/end.date&gt; &lt;/state.data.assimilation&gt; process.variance : [optional] TRUE/FLASE flag for if process variance should be estimated (TRUE) or not (FALSE). If TRUE, a generalized ensemble filter will be used. If FALSE, an ensemble Kalman filter will be used. Default is FALSE. sample.parameters : [optional] TRUE/FLASE flag for if parameters should be sampled for each ensemble member or not. This allows for more spread in the intial conditions of the forecast. NOTE: If TRUE, you must also assign a vector of trait names to pick.trait.params within the sda.enkf function. state.variable : [required] State variable that is to be assimilated (in PEcAn standard format). Default is “AGB” - Above Ground Biomass. spin.up : [required] start.date and end.date for model spin up. NOTE: start.date and end.date are distinct from values set in the run tag because spin up can be done over a subset of the run. forecast.time.step : [optional] start.date and end.date for model spin up. start.date : [required?] start date of the state data assimilation (in YYYY/MM/DD format) end.date : [required?] end date of the state data assimilation (in YYYY/MM/DD format) NOTE: start.date and end.date are distinct from values set in the run tag because this analysis can be done over a subset of the run.

This standard evolved out of MsTMIP project, which is itself based on NACP, LBA, and other model-intercomparison projects. This standard was expanded for the PalEON MIP and the needs of the PEcAn modeling community to support variables not in these standards. Model developers: do not add variables to your PEcAn output without first adding them to the PEcAn standard table! Also, do not create new variables equivalent to existing variables but just with different names or units. 13.1 BioCro Model Information Home Page Source Code License Authors PEcAn Integration Introduction Introduction about model PEcAn configuration file additions Should list the model specific additions to the PEcAn file here Model specific input files List of inputs required by model, such as met, etc. Model configuration files BioCro uses a config.xml file similar to ED2.

The values in this template are replaced by those computed in the earlier stages of PEcAN. Installation notes Installing the MAESPA model requires cloning the MAESPA Bitbucket Repository, executing the makefile, and ensuring that the Maeswarp R package is correctly installed. To clone and compile the model, execute this code at the command line git clone https://bitbucket.org/remkoduursma/maespa.git cd maespa make clean make maespa.out is your executable. Example input files can be found in the inputfiles directory. Executing measpa.out from within one of the example directories will produce output. MAESPA developers have also developed a wrapper package called Maeswrap. The usual R package installation method install.packages may present issues with downloading an unpacking a dependency package called rgl. Here are a couple of solutions: Solution 1 From the Command Line sudo apt-get install r-cran-rgl then from within R install.packages(&quot;Maeswrap&quot;) Solution 2 From the Command line sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev then from within R install.packages(&quot;Maeswrap&quot;) This section contains notes on how to compile the model.

["overview.html", "18 Overview 18.1 Bugs, Issues, Features, etc. 18.2 Requesting a feature 18.3 Closing an issue 18.4 When to submit an issue?", " 18 Overview We use GitHub to track development. To learn about GitHub, it is worth taking some time to read through the FAQ. When in doubt, the first step is to click the “Help” button at the top of the page. To address specific people, use a github feature called &quot;@mentions&quot; e.g. write @dlebauer, @robkooper, @mdietze, or @serbinsh … in the issue to alert the user as described in the GitHub documentation on notifications 18.1 Bugs, Issues, Features, etc. 18.1.1 Reporting a bug (For developers) work through debugging (see debugging wiki). Once you have identified a problem, that you can not resolve, you can write a bug report Write a bug report submit the bug report If you do find the answer, explain the resolution (in the issue) and close the issue 18.1.2 Required content Note: a bug is only a bug if it is reproducible clear bug reports save time Clear, specific title Description - What you did What you expected to happen What actually happened What does work, under what conditions does it fail? Reproduction steps - minimum steps required to reproduce the bug additional materials that could help identify the cause: screen shots stack traces, logs, scripts, output specific code and data / settings / configuration files required to reproduce the bug environment (operating system, browser, hardware) 18.2 Requesting a feature (from The Pragmatic Programmer, available as ebook through UI libraries, hardcopy on David’s bookshelf) * focus on “user stories”, e.g. specific use cases * Be as specific as possible, Here is an example: Bob is at www.mysite.edu/maps map of the the region (based on user location, e.g. US, Asia, etc) option to “use current location” is provided, if clicked, map zooms in to, e.g. state or county level for site run: option to select existing site or specify point by lat/lon option to specify a bounding box and grid resolution in either lat/lon or polar stereographic. asked to specify start and end times in terms of year, month, day, hour, minute. Time is recorded in UTC not local time, this should be indicated 18.3 Closing an issue Definition of “Done” test documentation when issue is resolved: status is changed to “resolved” assignee is changed to original author if original author agrees that issue has been resolved original author changes status to “closed” except for trivial issues, issues are only closed by the author 18.4 When to submit an issue? 18.4.1 Ideally, non-trivial code changes will be linked to an issue and a commit. This requires creating issues for each task, making small commits, and referencing the issue within your commit message. Issues can be created on GitHub. These issues can be linked to commits by adding text such as fixes gh-5 (see [[Using Git During Development|Using-Git#during-development]]). Rationale: This workflow is a small upfront investment that reduces error and time spent re-creating and debugging errors. Associating issues and commits, makes it easier to identify why a change was made, and potential bugs that could arise when the code is changed. In addition, knowing which issue you are working on clarifies the scope and objectives of your current task. "],
["using-git.html", "19 Using Git 19.1 Git 19.2 Recommended Git Workflow 19.3 During development: 19.4 For PEcAn 19.5 Git + Rstudio 19.6 For development: 19.7 References:", " 19 Using Git This document describes the steps required to download PEcAn, make changes to code, and submit your changes. For asking questions, reporting bugs, and requesting features, see our documentation for reporting issues on Redmine and GitHub If you are new to GitHub or to PEcAn, start with the one-time set-up instructions under Before any work is done. Also see the excellent tutorials and references in the References section at the the bottom of this page. To make trivial changes, see Quick and Easy To make changes to the code, start with the basic workflow. If you want to submit changes that you’ve made to be part of PEcAn you’ll want to follow Committing Changes Using Pull Requests To update your local branch cd pecan git pull upstream master ./scripts/build.sh 19.1 Git Git is a version control software; GitHub is a project-hosting website that is similar to Redmine but easier to use for open and collaborative development. Git is a free &amp; open source, distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server. Branching and merging are fast and easy to do. A good place to start is the GitHub 5 minute illustrated tutorial. In addition, there are three fun tutorials for learning git: Learn Git is a great web-based interactive tutorial. LearnGitBranching TryGit. For additional tutorials and background see References URLs In the rest of the document will use specific URL’s to clone the code. There a few URL’s you can use to clone a project, using https, ssh and git. You can use either https or git to clone a repository and write to it. The git protocol is read-only. 19.1.1 PEcAnProject on GitHub: https://github.com/organizations/PecanProject PEcAn source code: https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan.git git@github.com:PecanProject/pecan.git BETYdb source code: https://github.com/PecanProject/bety.git git@github.com:PecanProject/bety.git These instructions apply to other repositories too. 19.1.2 Milestones, Issues, Tasks The Milestones, issues, and tasks can be used to organize specific features or research projects. In general, there is a heirarchy: milestones (Big picture, “Epic”): contains many issues issues (Specific features / bugs, “Story”): may contain a list of tasks; represent task list (to do list, “Tasks”): list of steps required to close an issue, e.g.: ``` [ ] first do this [ ] then this [ ] completed when x and y ``` 19.1.3 Quick and Easy The easiest approach is to use GitHub’s browser based workflow. This is useful when your change is a few lines, if you are editing a wiki, or if the edit is trivial (and won’t break the code). The GitHub documentation is here but it is simple: finding the page or file you want to edit, click “edit” and then the GitHub web application will automatically forking and branch, then allow you to submit a pull request. However, it should be noted that unless you are a member of the PEcAn project that the “edit” button will not be active and you’ll want to follow the workflow described below for forking and then submitting a pull request. 19.2 Recommended Git Workflow Each feature should be in it’s own branch (for example each redmine issue is a branch, names of branches are often the issue in a bug tracking system). Commit and Push Frequency On your branch, commit at minimum once a day before you push changes: even better: every time you reach a stopping point and move to a new issue. best: any time that you have done work that you do not want to re-do. Remember, pushing changes to your branch is like saving a draft. Submit a pull request when you are done. 19.2.1 Before any work is done: The first step below only needs to be done once when you first start working on the PEcAn code. The steps below that need to be done to set up PEcAn on your computer, and would need to be repeated if you move to a new computer. If you are working from the PEcAn VM, you can skip the “git clone” since the PEcAn code is already installed. Most people will not be able to work in the PEcAn repository directly and will need to create a fork of the PEcAn source code in their own folder. To fork PEcAn into your own github space (github help: “fork a repo”). This forked repository will allow you to create branches and commit changes back to GitHub and create pull requests to the master of PEcAn. The forked repository is the only way for external people to commit code back to PEcAn and BETY. The pull request will start a review process that will eventually result in the code being merged into the main copy of the codebase. See https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo for more information, especially on how to keep your fork up to date with respect to the original. (Rstudio users should also see Git + Rstudio, below) You can setup SSH keys to make it easier to commit cod back to GitHub. This might especially be true if you are working from a cluster, see set up ssh keys Introduce yourself to GIT git config --global user.name &quot;FULLNAME&quot; git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com Fork PEcAn on GitHub. Goto the PEcAn source code and click on the Fork button in the upper right. This will create a copy of PEcAn in your personal space. Clone to your local machine git clone git@github.com:&lt;username&gt;/pecan.git Define upstream repository cd pecan git remote add upstream git@github.com:PecanProject/pecan.git 19.3 During development: commit often; each commit can address 0 or 1 issue; many commits can reference an issue (see [[Link commits to issue|Using-Git#link-commits-to-issues]]) ensure that all tests are passing before anything is pushed into master. 19.3.1 Basic Workflow PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS, SEE ADVANCED WORKFLOW! Get the latest code from the main repository git pull upstream master Do some coding Commit after each chunk of code (multiple times a day) git commit -m &quot;&lt;some descriptive information about what was done; references/fixes gh-X&gt;&quot; Push to YOUR Github (when a feature is working, a set of bugs are fixed, or you need to share progress with others) git push origin &lt;branchname&gt; Before submitting code back to the main repository, make sure that code compiles ./scripts/build.sh -c submit pull request with a reference to related issue (see [[Link commits to issue|Using-Git#link-commits-to-issues]]); also see github documentation 19.3.2 Advanced Workflow: A new branch for each change Make sure you start in master git checkout master Make sure master is up to date git pull upstream master Run any tests / make sure that code compiles For PEcAn: Build most recent versions of R packages (./scripts/build.sh -h for help)) ./scripts/build.sh For BETYdb (see BETY wiki) rspec Create a branch and switch to it git checkout -b &lt;branchname&gt; work/commit/etc git commit -m &quot;&lt;some descriptive information about what was done&gt;&quot; Run any tests / make sure that code compiles For PEcAn: ./scripts/build.sh -c Push this branch to your github space git push origin &lt;branchname&gt; submit pull request with [[link commits to issues|Using-Git#link-commits-to-issuess]]; also see explanation in this PecanProject/bety issue and github documentation 19.3.3 After pull request is merged Make sure you start in master git checkout master delete branch remotely git push origin --delete &lt;branchname&gt; delete branch locally git branch -D &lt;branchname&gt; 19.3.4 Link commits to issues You can reference and close issues from comments, pull requests, and commit messages. This should be done when you commit code that is related to or will close/fix an existing issue. There are two ways to do this. One easy way is to include the following text in your commit message: Github to close: “closes gh-xxx” (or syn. close, closed, fixes, fix, fixed) to reference: just the issue number (e.g. “gh-xxx”) avoid “closes #xxx” which will cross-reference Redmine issues Redmine: to close: “fixes redmine #xxx” (or closes etc.) to reference: “redmine #xxx” Bitbucket: to close: reference and use web interface! to reference: “re #xxx” Another way is to just add the url to the issue that you are updating. For example, if you are resolving an issue in Redmine, you can simply write the text “resolved by pull request https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/pull/1” in the comments. 19.4 For PEcAn ./scripts/build.sh -c 19.4.1 Committing Changes Using Pull Requests GitHub provides a useful overview of how to submit changes to a project, Using Pull Requests. Once you have added a feature on your local fork of the project that you would like to contribute, these are the steps: Submit a Pull Request Pull request is reviewed by a member of the PEcAn core group Any comments should be addressed Additional commits are added to the pull request When ready, changes are merged 19.4.2 Other Useful Git Commands: GIT encourages branching “early and often” First pull from master Branch before working on feature One branch per feature You can switch easily between branches Merge feature into main line when branch done git branch &lt;name of branch&gt; git checkout &lt;name of branch&gt; repeat write some code commit until done git checkout master git merge &lt;name of brach&gt; git push If during above process you want to work on something else, commit all your code, create a new branch, and work on new branch.

For more information see the Tagging Chapter in the Git documentation. Lightweight tags are useful, but here we discuss the annotated tags that are used for marking stable versions, major releases, and versions associated with published results. The basic command is git tag. The -a flag means ‘annotated’ and -m is used before a message. Here is an example: git tag -a v0.6 -m &quot;stable version with foo and bar features, used in the foobar publication by Bob&quot; Adding a tag to the a remote repository must be done explicitly with a push, e.g. git push v0.6 To use a tagged version, just checkout: git checkout v0.6 To tag an earlier commit, just append the commit SHA to the command, e.g. git tag -a v0.99 -m &quot;last version before 1.0&quot; 9fceb02 Using GitHub The easiest way to get working with GitHub is by installing the GitHub client. For instructions for your specific OS and download of the GitHub client, see https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git. This will help you set up an SSH key to push code back to GitHub. To check out a project you do not need to have an ssh key and you can use the https or git url to check out the code. 19.5 Git + Rstudio Rstudio is nicely integrated with many development tools, including git and GitHub. It is quite easy to check out source code from within the Rstudio program or browser. The Rstudio documentation includes useful overviews of version control and R package development. Once you have git installed on your computer (see the Rstudio version control documentation for instructions), you can use the following steps to install the PEcAn source code in Rstudio. 19.5.1 Creating a Read-only version: This is a fast way to clone the repository that does not support contributing new changes (this can be done with further modification). install Rstudio (www.rstudio.com) click (upper right) project create project version control Git - clone a project from a Git Repository paste https://www.github.com/PecanProject/pecan choose working dir. for repo 19.6 For development: create account on github create a fork of the PEcAn repository to your own account https://www.github.com/pecanproject/pecan install Rstudio (www.rstudio.com) generate an ssh key in Rstudio: Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Git/SVN -&gt; &quot;create RSA key&quot; View public key -&gt; ctrl+C to copy in GitHub go to ssh settings -&gt; 'add ssh key' -&gt; ctrl+V to paste -&gt; 'add key' Create project in Rstudio project (upper right) -&gt; create project -&gt; version control -&gt; Git - clone a project from a Git Repository paste repository url git@github.com:&lt;username&gt;/pecan.git&gt; choose working dir. for repository 19.7 References: 19.7.0.1 Git Documentation Scott Chacon, ‘Pro Git book’, http://git-scm.com/book GitHub help pages, https://help.github.com/ Main GIT page, http://git-scm.com/documentation Information about branches, http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ Another set of pages about branching, http://sandofsky.com/blog/git-workflow.html Stackoverflow highest voted questions tagged “git” 19.7.0.2 GitHub Documentation When in doubt, the first step is to click the “Help” button at the top of the page.

["adding-an-ecosystem-model.html", "21 Adding An Ecosystem Model 21.1 PEcAn Database 21.2 Define MODEL_TYPE 21.3 MACHINE 21.4 MODEL 21.5 FORMATS 21.6 INPUTS 21.7 PFTS (Plant Functional Types) 21.8 PRIORS 21.9 Interface Modules", " 21 Adding An Ecosystem Model Adding a model to PEcAn involves two activities: Updating the PEcAn database to register the model Writing the interface modules between the model and PEcAn Note that coupling a model to PEcAn should not require any changes to the model code itself. A key aspect of our design philosophy is that we want it to be easy to add models to the system and we want to using the working version of the code that is used by all other model users, not a special branch (which would rapidly end up out-of-date). 21.1 PEcAn Database To run a model within PEcAn requires that the PEcAn database know about the model – this includes a MODEL_TYPE designation, the types of inputs the model requires, the location of the model executable, and the plant functional types used by the model. The instructions below assume that you will be specifying this information using the BETYdb web-based interface. This can be done either on your local VM (localhost:3280/bety or localhost:6480/bety) or on a server installation of BETYdb, though in either case we’d encourage you to set up your PEcAn instance to support database syncs so that these changes can be shared and backed-up across the PEcAn network. The figure below summarizes the relevant database tables that need to be updated to add a new model and the primary variables that define each table. 21.2 Define MODEL_TYPE The first step to adding a model is to create a new MODEL_TYPE, which defines the abstract model class which we will then use to specify input requirements, define plant functional types, and keep track of different model versions. A MODEL_TYPE is created by selecting Runs &gt; Model Type and then clicking on New Model Type. The MODEL_TYPE name should be identical to the MODEL package name (see Interface Module below) and is case sensitive. 21.3 MACHINE The PEcAn design acknowledges that the same model executables and input files may exist on multiple computers. Therefore, we need to define the machine that that we are using. If you are running on the VM then the local machine is already defined as pecan32 or pecan64 for the 32-bit and 64-bit versions respectively. Otherwise, you will need to select Runs &gt; Machines, click New Machine, and enter the URL of your server (e.g. pecan2.bu.edu). 21.4 MODEL Next we are going to tell PEcAn where the model executable is. Select Runs &gt; Files, and click ADD. Use the pull down menu to specify the machine you just defined above and fill in the path and name for the executable. For example, if SIPNET is installed at /usr/local/bin/sipnet then the path is /usr/local/bin/ and the file (executable) is sipnet. Now we will create the model record and associate this with the File we just registered. The first time you do this select Runs &gt; Models and click New Model. Specify a descriptive name of the model (which doesn’t have to be the same as MODEL_TYPE), select the MODEL_TYPE from the pull down, and provide a revision identifier for the model (e.g. v3.2.1). Once the record is created select it from the Models table and click EDIT RECORD. Click on “View Related Files” and when the search window appears search for the model executable you just added (if you are unsure which file to choose you can go back to the Files menu and look up the unique ID number). You can then associate this Model record with the File by clicking on the +/- symbol. By contrast, clicking on the name itself will take you to the File record. In the future, if you set up the SAME MODEL VERSION on a different computer you can add that Machine and File to PEcAn and then associate this new File with this same Model record. A single version of a model should only be entered into PEcAn once. If a new version of the model is developed that is derived from the current version you should add this as a new Model record but with the same MODEL_TYPE as the original. Furthermore, you should set the previous version of the model as Parent of this new version. 21.5 FORMATS The PEcAn database keep track of all the input files passed to models, as well as any data used in model validation or data assimilation. Before we start to register these files with PEcAn we need to define the format these files will be in. To create a new format click on Runs &gt; Formats and click New Format. Lets start with the input meteorology used by your model. The first thing you need to do is specify the mime type of your met file (e.g. CSV, netCDF, etc) and then give a unique, descriptive name to your file format (e.g. SIPNET clim). If your met file is text-based you can also specify whether the file has a header or not (TRUE / FALSE) and if any lines need to be skipped before the header or start of file (skip = INTEGER). You can also enter a more descriptive Note that explains the format in more detail. 21.5.1 Formats -&gt; Variables After a Format entry has been created, you are encouraged to edit the entry to add relationships between the file’s variables and the Variables table in PEcAn. Not only do these relationships provide meta-data describing the file format, but they also allow PEcAn to search and (for some mime types) read files. To enter this data Edit the existing record and click on “View related variables”. For each variable in the file you will want at a minimum to specify the NAME of the variable within your file and match that to the equivalent Variable in the pulldown. If there is no equivalent, new Variables can be searched and added under Data &gt; Variables. If your input file and PEcAn already have the variable in the same units then the Unit column can be left blank, otherwise units should be specified in a format that can be parsed by the UDUNITS library. Storage Type only needs to be specified if the variable is stored in a format other than what would be expected (e.g. if numeric values are stored as quoted character strings). Finally, if your data is in text format with variables in a standard order then you can specify the Column Number for the variable. This is particularly important for text files that lack headers. 21.5.2 MODEL_TYPE -&gt; Formats For each of the input formats you specify for your model, you will need to edit your MODEL_TYPE record to add an association between the format and the MODEL_TYPE. Go to Runs &gt; Model Type, select your record and click on the Edit button. Next, click on “Edit Associated Formats” and choose the Format you just defined from the pull down menu. If the Input box is checked then all matching Input records will be displayed in the PEcAn site run selection page when you are defining a model run. In other words, the set of model inputs available through the PEcAn web interface is model-specific and dynamically generated from the associations between MODEL_TYPEs and Formats. If you also check the Required box, then the Input will be treated as required and PEcAn will not run the model if that input is not available. Furthermore, on the site selection webpage, PEcAn will filter the available sites and only display pins on the Google Map for sites that have a full set of required inputs (or where those inputs could be generated using PEcAn’s workflows). Similarly, to make a site appear on the Google Map, all you need to do is specify Inputs, as described in the next section, and the point should automatically appear on the map. 21.6 INPUTS After a file Format has been created then input files can be registered with the database. The first step for this is to create a new File entry for the file (Runs &gt; Files; New File) same as you did when you added the model executable. Next an Input record is created (Runs &gt; Inputs; New Input) by selecting the Site the data are from, the data Format, the date range, and specifying a Name for the Input. If you are adding an input for a Site that doesn’t exist in the database you will want to create a new site (Data &gt; Sites; New Site) and give it a name, latitude, and longitude. After the Input record is created you Edit the record and use “View related files” to associate the File with the Input. As with Models, if the exact same Input file exists in multiple place or over multiple machines then you can create multiple File entries for each of those files but associate each with the same Input. Doing so makes it simple for PEcAn to move between machines since the Input record stays the same for a give model run and the system just looks up where the local copy of the file is stored. Additional detail for creating Inputs can be found under [How to insert new Input data]. 21.7 PFTS (Plant Functional Types) Since many of the PEcAn tools are designed to keep track of parameter uncertainties and assimilate data into models, to use PEcAn with a model it is important to define Plant Functional Types for the sites or regions that you will be running the model. PFTs are MODEL_TYPE specific, so when you create a new PFT entry (Data &gt; PFTs; New PFT) you will want to choose your MODEL_TYPE from the pull down and then give the PFT a descriptive name (e.g. temperate deciduous). 21.7.1 Species Within PEcAn there are no predefined PFTs and user can create new PFTs very easily at whatever taxonomic level is most appropriate, from PFTs for individual species up to one PFT for all plants globally. To allow PEcAn to query its trait database for information about a PFT, you will want to associate species with the PFT record by choosing Edit and then “View Related Species”. Species can be searched for by common or scientific name and then added to a PFT using the +/- button. 21.8 PRIORS In addition to adding species, a PFT is defined in PEcAn by the list of variables associated with the PFT. PEcAn takes a fundamentally Bayesian approach to representing model parameters, so variables are not entered as fixed constants but as Prior probability distributions (see below). Once Priors are defined for each model variable then you Edit the PFT and use “View Related Priors” to search for and add Prior distributions for each model parameter. It is important to note that the priors are defined for the variable name and units as specified in the Variables table. If the variable name or units is different within the model it is the responsibility of write.configs.MODEL function to handle name and unit conversions (see Interface Modules below). This can also include common but nonlinear transformations, such as converting SLA to LMA or changing the reference temperature for respiration rates. There are a wide variety of priors already defined in the PEcAn database that often range from very diffuse and generic to very informative priors for specific PFTs. If the current set of Priors for a variable are inadequate, or if a prior needs to be specified for a new variable, this can be done under Data &gt; Priors then “New Prior”. After using the pull-down menu to select the Variable you want to generate a prior for, the prior is defined by choosing a probability distribution and specifying values for that distribution’s parameters. These are labeled Parameter a &amp; b but their exact meaning depends upon the distribution chosen. For example, for the Normal distribution a and b are the mean and standard deviation while for the Uniform they are the minimum and maximum. All parameters are defined based on their standard parameterization in the R language. If the prior is based on observed data (independent of data in the PEcAn database) then you can also specify the prior sample size, N. The Phylogeny variable allows one to specify what taxonomic grouping the prior is defined for, at it is important to note that this is just for reference and doesn’t have to be specified in any standard way nor does it have to be monophyletic (i.e. it can be a functional grouping). Finally, the Citation is a required variable that provides a reference for how the prior was defined. That said, there are a number of unpublished Citations in current use that simply state the expert opinion of an individual. Additional information on adding PFTs, Species, and Priors can be found under [[Choosing PFTs]] 21.9 Interface Modules 21.9.1 Setting up the module directory (required) PEcAn assumes that the interface modules are available as an R package in the models directory named after the model in question. The simplest way to get started on that R package is to make a copy the template directory in the pecan/models folder and re-name it to the name of your model. In the code, filenames, and examples below you will want to substitute the word MODEL for the name of your model (note: R is case-sensitive). If you do not want to write the interface modules in R then it is fairly simple to set up the R functions describe below to just call the script you want to run using R’s system command. Scripts that are not R functions should be placed in the inst folder and R can look up the location of these files using the function system.file which takes as arguments the local path of the file within the package folder and the name of the package (typically PEcAn.MODEL). For example ## Example met conversion wrapper function met2model.MODEL &lt;- function(in.path, in.prefix, outfolder, start_date, end_date){ myMetScript &lt;- system.file(&quot;inst/met2model.MODEL.sh&quot;, &quot;PEcAn.MODEL&quot;) system(paste(myMetScript, file.path(in.path, in.prefix), outfolder, start_date, end_date)) } would execute the following at the Linux command line inst/met2model.MODEL.sh in.path/in.prefix outfolder start_date end_date ` 21.9.2 DESCRIPTION Within the module folder open the DESCRIPTION file and change the package name to PEcAn.MODEL. Fill out other fields such as Title, Author, Maintainer, and Date. 21.9.3 NAMESPACE Open the NAMESPACE file and change all instances of MODEL to the name of your model. If you are not going to implement one of the optional modules (described below) at this time then you will want to comment those out using the pound sign #. For a complete description of R NAMESPACE files see here. If you create additional functions in your R package that you want to be used make sure you include them in the NAMESPACE as well (internal functions don’t need to be declared) 21.9.4 Building the package Once the package is defined you will then need to add it to the PEcAn build scripts. From the root of the pecan directory, go into the scripts folder and open the file build.sh. Within the section of code that includes PACKAGES= add model/MODEL to the list of packages to compile. If, in writing your module, you add any other R packages to the system you will want to make sure those are listed in the DESCRIPTION and in the script scripts/install.dependencies.R. Next, from the root pecan directory open all/DESCRIPTION and add your model package to the Suggests: list. At any point, if you want to check if PEcAn can build your MODEL package successfully, just go to the linux command prompt and run scripts/build.sh. You will need to do this before the system can use these packages. 21.9.5 write.config.MODEL (required) This module performs two primary tasks. The first is to take the list of parameter values and model input files that it receives as inputs and write those out in whatever format(s) the MODEL reads (e.g. a settings file). The second is to write out a shell script, jobs.sh, which, when run, will start your model run and convert its output to the PEcAn standard (netCDF with metadata currently equivalent to the MsTMIP standard). Within the MODEL directory take a close look at inst/template.job and the example write.config.MODEL to see an example of how this is done. It is important that this script writes or moves outputs to the correct location so that PEcAn can find them. The example function also shows an example of writing a model-specific settings/config file, also by using a template. You are encouraged to read the section above on defining PFTs before writing write.config.MODEL so that you understand what model parameters PEcAn will be passing you, how they will be named, and what units they will be in. Also note that the (optional) PEcAn input/driver processing scripts are called by separate workflows, so the paths to any required inputs (e.g. meteorology) will already be in the model-specific format by the time write.config.MODEL receives that info. 21.9.6 Output Conversions The module model2netcdf.MODEL converts model output into the PEcAn standard (netCDF with metadata currently equivalent to the MsTMIP standard). This function was previously required, but now that the conversion is called within jobs.sh it may be easier for you to convert outputs using other approaches (or to just directly write outputs in the standard). Whether you implement this function or convert outputs some other way, please note that PEcAn expects all outputs to be broken up into ANNUAL files with the year number as the file name (i.e. YEAR.nc), though these files may contain any number of scalars, vectors, matrices, or arrays of model outputs, such as time-series of each output variable at the model’s native timestep. Note: PEcAn reads all variable names from the files themselves so it is possible to add additional variables that are not part of the MsTMIP standard. Similarly, there are no REQUIRED output variables, though time is highly encouraged. We are shortly going establish a canonical list of PEcAn variables so that if users add additional output variables they become part of the standard. We don’t want two different models to call the same output with two different names or different units as this would prohibit the multi-model syntheses and comparisons that PEcAn is designed to facilitate. 21.9.7 met2model.MODEL met2model.MODEL(in.path, in.prefix, outfolder, start_date, end_date) Converts meteorology input files from the PEcAn standard (netCDF, CF metadata) to the format required by the model. This file is optional if you want to load all of your met files into the Inputs table as described in [How to insert new Input data], which is often the easiest way to get up and running quickly. However, this function is required if you want to benefit from PEcAn’s meteorology workflows and model run cloning. You’ll want to take a close look at [Adding-an-Input-Converter] to see the exact variable names and units that PEcAn will be providing. Also note that PEcAn splits all meteorology up into ANNUAL files, with the year number explicitly included in the file name, and thus what PEcAn will actually be providing is in.path, the input path to the folder where multiple met files may stored, and in.prefix, the start of the filename that precedes the year (i.e. an individual file will be named .YEAR.nc). It is valid for in.prefix to be blank. The additional REQUIRED arguments to met2model.MODEL are outfolder, the output folder where PEcAn wants you to write your meteorology, and start_date and end_date, the time range the user has asked the meteorology to be processed for. 21.9.8 Commit changes Once the MODEL modules are written, you should follow the Using-Git instructions on how to commit your changes to your local git repository, verify that PEcAn compiles using scripts/build.sh, push these changes to Github, and submit a pull request so that your model module is added to the PEcAn system. It is important to note that while we encourage users to make their models open, adding the PEcAn interface module to the Github repository in no way requires that the model code itself be made public. It does, however, allow anyone who already has a copy of the model code to use PEcAn so we strongly encourage that any new model modules be committed to Github. General Note: dates in the database should be datatime (preferably with timezone), and datetime passed around in PEcAn should be of type POSIXlt. "],
["met-data.html", "22 Met Data 22.1 Dimensions: 22.2 The variable names should be standard_name", " 22 Met Data The standard met data inputs should be of the form: Converters from a raw to standard format go in /modules/data.atmosphere/R; converters from standard to model-specific go in models/&lt;mymodel&gt;/R. For a number of common gridded products (NARR, CRUNCEP, ISIMIP), there are bash scripts for converting and rechunking in this repository: https://github.com/ebimodeling/model-drivers; these are not generalized, but may be merged into PEcAn at some point.

For example, in the MsTMIP-CRUNCEP data, the variable rain should be precipitation_rate. We want to standardize the units as well as part of the met2CF.&lt;product&gt; step. I believe we want to use the CF “canonical” units but retain the MsTMIP units any time CF is ambiguous about the units. The key is to process each type of met data (site, reanalysis, forecast, climate scenario, etc) to the exact same standard. This way every operation after that (extract, gap fill, downscale, convert to a model, etc) will always have the exact same inputs. This will make everything else much simpler to code and allow us to avoid a lot of unnecessary data checking, tests, etc being repeated in every downstream function. In addition to the state assimilation routines found in the assim.sequential module, another approach for state data assimilation in PEcAn is through the DART workflow created by the DARES group in NCAR. This section gives a straight-forward explanation how to implement DART, focused on the technical aspects of the implementation. If there are any questions, feel free to send @Viskari an email (tt.viskari@gmail.com) or contacting DART support as they are quite awesome in helping people with problems. Also, if there are any suggestions on how to improve the wiki, please let me know. Running with current folders in PEcAn Currently the DART folders in PEcAn are that you can simply copy the structure there over a downloaded DART workflow and it should replace/add relevant files and folders. The most important step after that is to check and change the run paths in the following files: Path_name files in the work folders T_ED2IN file, as it indicates where the run results be written. advance_model.csh, as it indicates where to copy files from/to. Second thing is setting the state vector size. This is explained in more detail below, but essentially this is governed by the variable model_size in model_mod.f90. In addition to this, it should be changed in utils/F2R.f90 and R2F.f90 programs, which are responsible for reading and writing state variable information for the different ensembles. This also will be expanded below. Finally, the new state vector size should be updated for any other executable that runs it. Third thing needed are the initial condition and observation sequence files. They will always follow the same format and are explained in more detail below. Finally the ensemble size, which is the easiest to change. In the work subfolder, there is a file named input.nml. Simply changing the ensemble size there will set it for the run itself. Also remember that initial conditions file should have the equal amount of state vectors as there are ensemble members. Adjusting the workflow The central file for the actual workflow is advance_model.csh. It is a script DART calls to determine how the state vector changes between the two observation times and is essentially the only file one needs to change when changing state models or observations operators. The file itself should be commented to give a good idea of the flow, but beneath is a crude order of events. 1. Create a temporary folder to run the model in and copy/link required files in to it. 2. Read in the state vector values and times from DART. Here it is important to note that the values will be in binary format, which need to be read in by a Fortran program. In my system, there is a program called F2R which reads in the binary values and writes out in ascii form the state vector values as well as which ED2 history files it needs to copy based on the time stamps. 3. Run the observation operator, which writes the state vector state in to the history files and adjusts them if necessary. 4. Run the program. 5. Read the new state vector values from output files. 6. Convert the state vector values to the binary. In my system, this is done by the program R2F. Initial conditions file The initial conditions file, commonly named filter_ics although you can set it to something else in input.nml, is relatively simple in structure. It has one sequence repeating over the number of ensemble members. First line contains two times: Seconds and days. Just use one of them in this situation, but it has to match the starting time given in input.nml. After that each line should contain a value from the state vector in the order you want to treat them. R functions filter_ics.R and B_filter_ics.R in the R folder give good examples of how to create these. Observations files The file which contains the observations is commonly known as obs_seq.out, although again the name of the file can be changed in input.nml. The structure of the file is relatively straight-forward and the R function ObsSeq.R in the R subfolder has the write structure for this. Instead of writing it out here, I want to focus on a few really important details in this file. Each observations will have a time, a value, an uncertainty, a location and a kind. The first four are self-explanatory, but the kind is really important, but also unfortunately really easy to misunderstand. In this file, the kind does not refer to a unit or a type of observation, but which member of the state vector is this observation of. So if the kind was, for example, 5, it would mean that it was of the fifth member of the state vector. However, if the kind value is positive, the system assumes that there is some sort of an operator change in comparing the observation and state vector value which is specified in a subprogram in model_mod.f90. So for an direct identity comparison between the observation and the state vector value, the kind needs to be negative number of the state vector component. Thus, again if the observation is of the fifth state vector value, the kind should be set as -5. Thus it is recommendable that the state vector values have already been altered to be comparable with the observations. As for location, there are many ways to set in DART and the method needs to be chosen when compiling the code by giving the program which of the location mods it is to use. In our examples we used a 1-dimensional location vector with scaled values between 0 and 1. For future it makes sense to switch to a 2 dimensional long- and lat-scale, but for the time being the location does not impact the system a lot. The main impact will be if the covariances will be localized, as that will be decided on their locations. State variable vector in DART Creating/adjusting a state variable vector in DART is relatively straight-forward. Below are listed the steps to specify a state variable vector in DART. I. For each specific model, there should be an own folder within the DART root models folder. In this folder there is a model_mod.f90, which contains the model specific subroutines necessary for a DART run. At the beginning of this file there should be the following line: integer, parameter :: model_size = [number] The number here should be the number of variables in the vector. So for example if there were three state variables, then the line should look like this: integer, parameter :: model_size = 3 This number should also be changed to match with any of the other executables called during the run as indicated by the list above. In the DART root, there should be a folder named obs_kind, which contains a file called DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90. It is important to note that all changes should be done to this file instead of obs_kind_mod.f90, as during compilation DART creates obs_kind_mod.f90 from DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90. This program file contains all the defined observation types used by DART and numbers them for easier reference later. Different types are classified according to observation instrument or relevant observation phenomenon. Adding a new type only requires finding an unused number and starting a new identifying line with the following: integer, parameter, public :: &amp; KIND_… Note that the observation kind should always be easy to understand, so avoid using unnecessary acronyms. For example, when adding an observation type for Leaf Area Index, it would look like below: integer, parameter, public :: &amp; KIND_LEAF_AREA_INDEX = [number] In the DART root, there should be a folder named obs_def, which contains several files starting with obs_def_. There files contain the different available observation kinds classified either according to observation instrument or observable system. Each file starts with the line ! BEGIN DART PREPROCESS KIND LIST And end with line ! END DART PREPROCESS KIND LIST The lines between these two should contain ! The desired observation reference, the observation type, COMMON_CODE. For example, for observations relating to phenology, I have created a file called obs_def_phen_mod.f90. In this file I define the Leaf Area Index observations in the following way. ! BEGIN DART PREPROCESS KIND LIST ! LAI, TYPE_LEAF_AREA_INDEX, COMMON_CODE ! END DART PREPROCESS KIND LIST Note that the exclamation marks are necessary for the file. In the model specific folder, in the work subfolder there is a namelist file input.nml. This contains all the run specific information for DART. In it, there is a subtitle &amp;preprocess, under which there is a line input_files = ‘….’ This input_files sections must be set to refer to the obs_def file created in step III. The input files can contain references to multiple obs_def files if necessary. As an example, the reference to the obs_def_phen_mod.f90 would look like input_files = ‘../../../obs_def/obs_def_phen_mod.f90’ V. Finally, as an optional step, the different values in state vector can be typed. In model_mod, referred to in step I, there is a subroutine get_state_meta_data. In it, there is an input variable index_in, which refers to the vector component. So for instance for the second component of the vector index_in would be 2. If this is done, the variable kind has to be also included at the beginning of the model_mod.f90 file, at the section which begins use obs_kind_mod, only :: The location of the variable can be set, but for a 0-dimensional model we are discussing here, this is not necessary. Here, though, it is possible to set the variable types by including the following line if(index_in .eq. [number]) var_type = [One of the variable kinds set in step II] If the length of the state vector is changed, it is important that the script ran with DART produces a vector of that length. Change appropriately if necessary. After these steps, DART should be able to run with the state vector of interest. PEcAn has a single xml configuration file. This fill will dictate what models to run, where, with what input files and for how long. Each model has its own configuration file as well. 22.2.1 PEcAn Configuration Files This file is often called pecan.xml. The system will try to find this file in the following locations: * Passed in when calling R with –settings * Passed in to read.settings() function * PECAN_SETTINGS environment variable * File called pecan.xml in the current working folder Once any of these are loaded it will try to locate a pecan.xml in the outdir specified in the loaded file. 22.2.2 Model-specific configuration files ED2 SIPNET BIOCRO "],
["coding-style.html", "23 Coding Style 23.1 Use Roxygen2 documentation 23.2 Write your name at the top 23.3 Use testthat testing package 23.4 Don’t use shortcuts 23.5 Package Dependencies:", " 23 Coding Style Consistent coding style improves readability and reduces errors in shared code. R does not have an official style guide, but Hadley Wickham provides one that is well thought out and widely adopted. Advanced R: Coding Style. Both the Wickham text and this page are derived from Google’s R Style Guide. 23.1 Use Roxygen2 documentation This is the standard method of documentation used in PEcAn development, it provides inline documentation similar to doxygen. Even trivial functions should be documented. See Roxygen2 Wiki page 23.2 Write your name at the top Any function that you create or make a meaningful contribution to should have your name listed after the author tag in the function documentation. 23.3 Use testthat testing package See Unit_Testing wiki for instructions, and Advanced R: Tests. tests provide support for documentation - they define what a function is (and is not) expected to do all functions need tests to ensure basic functionality is maintained during development. all bugs should have a test that reproduces the bug, and the test should pass before bug is closed 23.4 Don’t use shortcuts R provides many shortcuts that are useful when coding interactively, or for writing scripts. However, these can make code more difficult to read and can cause problems when written into packages. 23.4.1 Function Names (verb.noun) Following convention established in PEcAn 0.1, we use the all lowercase with periods to separate words. They should generally have a verb.noun format, such as query.traits, get.samples, etc. 23.4.2 File Names File names should end in .R, .Rdata, .Rscript and should be meaningful, e.g. named after the primary functions that they contain. There should be a separate file for each major high-level function to aid in identifying the contents of files in a directory. 23.4.3 Use “&lt;-” as an assignment operator Because most R code uses &lt;- (except where = is required), we will use &lt;- “=” is used for function arguments 23.4.4 Use Spaces around all binary operators (=, +, -, &lt;-, etc.). after but not before a comma 23.4.5 Use curly braces The option to omit curly braces is another shortcut that makes code easier to write but harder to read and more prone to error. 23.5 Package Dependencies: 23.5.1 library vs require When another package is required by a function or script, it can be called in the following ways: (As a package dependency loads with the package, these should be the default approaches when writing functions in a package. There can be some exceptions, such as when a rarely-used or non-essential function requires an esoteric package.) 1. When using library, if dependency is not met, it will print an error and stop 2. When using require, it will print a warning and continue (but will throw an error when a function from the required package is called) Reference: Stack Overflow “What is the difference between require and library?” 23.5.2 DEPENDS, SUGGESTS, IMPORTS It is considered best practice to use DEPENDS and SUGGESTS in DESCRIPTION; SUGGESTS should be used for packages that are called infrequently, or only in examples and vignettes; suggested packages are called by require inside a function. Consider using IMPORTS instead of depends in the DESCRIPTION files. This will make loading packages faster by allowing it to have functions available without loading the hierarchy of dependencies, dependencies of dependencies, ad infinitum … From p. 6 of the “R extensions manual”:http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html The Suggests field uses the same syntax as Depends and lists packages that are not necessarily needed. This includes packages used only in examples, tests or vignettes (see Section 1.4 [Writing package vignettes], page 26), and packages loaded in the body of functions. E.g., suppose an example from package foo uses a dataset from package bar. Then it is not necessary to have bar use foo unless one wants to execute all the examples/tests/vignettes: it is useful to have bar, but not necessary. Version requirements can be specified, and will be used by R CMD check. "],

["testing.html", "25 Testing 25.1 Rationale 25.2 Tests makes development easier and less error prone 25.3 Quick Start: 25.4 Test files", " 25 Testing PEcAn uses the testthat package developed by Hadley Wickham. Hadley has written instructions for using this pakcage in his Testing chapter. 25.1 Rationale makes development easier provides working documentation of expected functionality saves time by allowing computer to take over error checking once a test has been made improves code quality Further reading: Aruliah et al 2012 Best Practices for Scientific Computing 25.2 Tests makes development easier and less error prone Testing makes it easier to develop by organizing everything you are already doing anyway - but integrating it into the testing and documentation. With a codebase like PEcAn, it is often difficult to get started. You have to figure out what was I doing yesterday? what do I want to do today? what existing functions do I need to edit? what are the arguements to these functions (and what are examples of valid arguments) what packages are affected where is a logical place to put files used in testing 25.3 Quick Start: decide what you want to do today identify the issue in redmine or github (if none exists, create one) to work on issue 99, create a new branch called “redmine99”, “github99” or some descriptive name… Today we will add enable an existing function, make.cheas to make goat.cheddar. We will know that we are done by the color and taste. git branch goat-cheddar git checkout goat-cheddar * open existing (or create new) file in `inst/tests/`. If working on code in &quot;myfunction&quot; or a set of functions in &quot;R/myfile.R&quot;, the file should be named accordingly, e.g. &quot;inst/tests/test.myfile.R&quot; * if you are lucky, the function has already been tested and has some examples. * if not, you may need to create a minimal example, often requiring a settings file. The default settings file can be obtained in this way: settings &lt;- read.settings(system.file(&quot;extdata/test.settings.xml&quot;, package = &quot;PEcAn.utils&quot;)) * write what you want to do test_that(&quot;make.cheas can make cheese&quot;,{ goat.cheddar &lt;- make.cheas(source = &#39;goat&#39;, style = &#39;cheddar&#39;) expect_equal(color(goat.cheddar), &quot;orange&quot;) expect_is(object = goat.cheddar, class = &quot;cheese&quot;) expect_true(all(c(&quot;sharp&quot;, &quot;creamy&quot;) %in% taste(goat.cheddar))) } * now edit the goat.cheddar function until it makes savory, creamy, orange cheese. * commit often * update documentation and test ```r library(devtools) document(&quot;mypkg&quot;) test(&quot;mypkg&quot;) ``` * commit again * when complete, merge, and push ```bash git commit -m &quot;make.cheas makes goat.cheddar now&quot; git checkout master git merge goat-cheddar git push ``` 25.4 Test files Many of PEcAn’s functions require inputs that are provided as data. These can be in the /data or the /inst/extdata folders of a package. Data that are not package specific should be placed in the PEcAn.all or PEcAn.utils files. Some useful conventions: 25.4.1 Settings A generic settings can be found in the PEcAn.all package settings.xml &lt;- system.file(&quot;pecan.biocro.xml&quot;, package = &quot;PEcAn.BIOCRO&quot;) settings &lt;- read.settings(settings.xml) database settings can be specified, and tests run only if a connection is available We currently use the following database to run tests against; tests that require access to a database should be enclosed by if(db.exists()) to avoid failed tests on systems that do not have the database installed. settings$database &lt;- list(userid = &quot;bety&quot;, passwd = &quot;bety&quot;, name = &quot;bety&quot;, # database name host = &quot;localhost&quot; # server name) if(db.exists()){ test_that(... ## write tests here } instructions for installing this are available on the VM creation wiki examples can be found in the PEcAn.DB package (db/inst/tests/). Model specific settings can go in the model-specific module, for example: settings.xml &lt;- system.file(&quot;pecan.biocro.xml&quot;, package = &quot;PEcAn.BIOCRO&quot;) settings &lt;- read.settings(settings.xml) test-specific settings: settings text can be specified inline: settings.text &lt;- &quot; &lt;pecan&gt; &lt;nocheck&gt;nope&lt;/nocheck&gt; ## allows bypass of checks in the read.settings functions &lt;pfts&gt; &lt;pft&gt; &lt;name&gt;ebifarm.pavi&lt;/name&gt; &lt;outdir&gt;test/&lt;/outdir&gt; &lt;/pft&gt; &lt;/pfts&gt; &lt;outdir&gt;test/&lt;/outdir&gt; &lt;database&gt; &lt;userid&gt;bety&lt;/userid&gt; &lt;passwd&gt;bety&lt;/passwd&gt; &lt;location&gt;localhost&lt;/location&gt; &lt;name&gt;bety&lt;/name&gt; &lt;/database&gt; &lt;/pecan&gt;&quot; settings &lt;- read.settings(settings.text) values in settings can be updated: settings &lt;- read.settings(settings.text) settings$outdir &lt;- &quot;/tmp&quot; ## or any other settings 25.4.2 Helper functions created to make testing easier tryl returns FALSE if function gives error temp.settings creates temporary settings file test.remote returns TRUE if remote connection is available db.exists returns TRUE if connection to database is available 25.4.3 When should I test? A test should be written for each of the following situations: Each bug should get a regression test. The first step in handling a bug is to write code that reproduces the error This code becomes the test most important when error could re-appear essential when error silently produces invalid results Every time a (non-trivial) function is created or edited Write tests that indicate how the function should perform example: expect_equal(sum(1,1), 2) indicates that the sum function should take the sum of its arguments Write tests for cases under which the function should throw an error example: expect_error(sum(&quot;foo&quot;) better : expect_error(sum(&quot;foo&quot;), &quot;invalid 'type' (character)&quot;) 25.4.4 What types of testing are important to understand? 25.4.5 Unit Testing / Test Driven Development Tests are only as good as the test write test write code 25.4.6 Regression Testing When a bug is found, write a test that finds the bug (the minimum test required to make the test fail) fix the bug bug is fixed when test passes 25.4.7 How should I test in R? The testthat package. tests are found in ~/pecan/&lt;packagename&gt;/inst/tests, for example utils/inst/tests/ See attached file and https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki/Testing for details on how to use the testthat package. 25.4.7.1 List of Expectations Full Abbreviation expect_that(x, is_true()) expect_true(x) expect_that(x, is_false()) expect_false(x) expect_that(x, is_a(y)) expect_is(x, y) expect_that(x, equals(y)) expect_equal(x, y) expect_that(x, is_equivalent_to(y)) expect_equivalent(x, y) expect_that(x, is_identical_to(y)) expect_identical(x, y) expect_that(x, matches(y)) expect_matches(x, y) expect_that(x, prints_text(y)) expect_output(x, y) expect_that(x, shows_message(y)) expect_message(x, y) expect_that(x, gives_warning(y)) expect_warning(x, y) expect_that(x, throws_error(y)) expect_error(x, y) 25.4.7.2 How to run tests add the following to “pecan/tests/run.all.R” library(testthat) library(mypackage) test_package(&quot;mypackage&quot;) 25.4.8 basic use of the testthat package Here is an example of tests (these should be placed in &lt;packagename&gt;/inst/tests/test_&lt;sourcefilename&gt;.R: test_that(&quot;mathematical operators plus and minus work as expected&quot;,{ expect_equal(sum(1,1), 2) expect_equal(sum(-1,-1), -2) expect_equal(sum(1,NA), NA) expect_error(sum(&quot;cat&quot;)) set.seed(0) expect_equal(sum(matrix(1:100)), sum(data.frame(1:100))) }) test_that(&quot;different testing functions work, giving excuse to demonstrate&quot;,{ expect_identical(1, 1) expect_identical(numeric(1), integer(1)) expect_equivalent(numeric(1), integer(1)) expect_warning(mean(&#39;1&#39;)) expect_that(mean(&#39;1&#39;), gives_warning(&quot;argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA&quot;)) expect_warning(mean(&#39;1&#39;), &quot;argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA&quot;) expect_message(message(&quot;a&quot;), &quot;a&quot;) }) 25.4.8.1 Script testing It is useful to add tests to a script during development. This allows you to test that the code is doing what you expect it to do. * here is a fake script using the iris data set test_that(&quot;the iris data set has the same basic features as before&quot;,{ expect_equal(dim(iris), c(150,5)) expect_that(iris$Sepal.Length, is_a(&quot;numeric&quot;)) expect_is(iris$Sepal.Length, &quot;numeric&quot;)#equivalent to prev. line expect_is(iris$Species, &quot;factor&quot;) }) iris.color &lt;- data.frame(Species = c(&quot;setosa&quot;, &quot;versicolor&quot;, &quot;virginica&quot;), color = c(&quot;pink&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;)) newiris &lt;- merge(iris, iris.color) iris.model &lt;- lm(Petal.Length ~ color, data = newiris) test_that(&quot;changes to Iris code occurred as expected&quot;,{ expect_that(dim(newiris), equals(c(150, 6))) expect_that(unique(newiris$color), is_identical_to(unique(iris.color$color))) expect_equivalent(iris.model$coefficients[&quot;(Intercept)&quot;], 4.26) }) 25.4.8.2 Function testing Testing of a new function, as.sequence. The function and documentation are in source:R/utils.R and the tests are in source:tests/test.utils.R. Recently, I made the function as.sequence to turn any vector into a sequence, with custom handling of NA’s: function(x, na.rm = TRUE){ x2 &lt;- as.integer(factor(x, unique(x))) if(all(is.na(x2))){ x2 &lt;- rep(1, length(x2)) } if(na.rm == TRUE){ x2[is.na(x2)] &lt;- max(x2, na.rm = TRUE) + 1 } return(x2) } The next step was to add documentation and test. Many people find it more efficient to write tests before writing the function. This is true, but it also requires more discipline. I wrote these tests to handle the variety of cases that I had observed. As currently used, the function is exposed to a fairly restricted set of options - results of downloads from the database and transformations. test_that(“as.sequence works”;{ expect_identical(as.sequence(c(“a”, “b”)), 1:2) expect_identical(as.sequence(c(“a”, NA)), 1:2) expect_equal(as.sequence(c(“a”, NA), na.rm = FALSE), c(1,NA)) expect_equal(as.sequence(c(NA,NA)), c(1,1)) }) "],

(data ensures that the utils package is attached, in case it had been run via utils::data.) * files ending .RData or .rda are load()ed. * files ending .tab, .txt or .TXT are read using read.table(..., header = TRUE), and hence result in a data frame. * files ending .csv or .CSV are read using read.table(..., header = TRUE, sep = ';'), and also result in a data frame. If your data does not fall in those 4 categories, or you can use the system.file function to get access to the data: system.file(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;ed.trait.dictionary.csv&quot;, package=&quot;PEcAn.utils&quot;) [1] &quot;/home/kooper/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/2.15/PEcAn.utils/data/ed.trait.dictionary.csv&quot; The arguments are folder, filename(s) and then package. It will return the fully qualified path name to a file in a package, in this case it points to the trait data. This is almost the same as the data function, however we can now use any function to read the file, such as read.csv instead of read.csv2 which seems to be the default of data.

["logging.html", "27 Logging 27.1 PEcAn logging functions 27.2 Other R logging packages 27.3 Example Usage 27.4 Inputs 27.5 Outputs", " 27 Logging During development we often add many print statements to check to see how the code is doing, what is happening, what intermediate results there are etc. When done with the development it would be nice to turn this additional code off, but have the ability to quickly turn it back on if we discover a problem. This is where logging comes into play. Logging allows us to use “rules” to say what information should be shown. For example when I am working on the code to create graphs, I do not have to see any debugging information about the SQL command being sent, however trying to figure out what goes wrong during a SQL statement it would be nice to show the SQL statements without adding any additional code. 27.1 PEcAn logging functions These logger family of functions are more sophisticated, and can be used in place of stop, warn, print, and similar functions. The logger functions make it easier to print to a system log file. 27.1.1 Examples The file test.logger.R provides descriptive examples This query provides an current overview of functions that use logging logger functions (in order of increasing level): logger.debug logger.info logger.warn logger.error the logger.setLevel function sets the level at which a message will be printed logger.setLevel(&quot;DEBUG&quot;) will print messages from all logger functions logger.setLevel(&quot;ERROR&quot;) will only print messages from logger.error logger.setLevel(&quot;INFO&quot;) and logger.setLevel(&quot;WARN&quot;) shows messages fromlogger.and higher functions, e.g.logger.setLevel(“WARN”)shows messages fromlogger.warnandlogger.error` logger.setLevel(&quot;OFF&quot;) suppresses all logger messages To print all messages to console, use logger.setUseConsole(TRUE) 27.1.2 Related Issues (requires Redmine developer account) #1071 How to handle errors? #1222 Ignore warnings You can use @logger.setLevel(“ERROR”)@ to only show error messages. All the code that does not use logger will not be filtered. 27.2 Other R logging packages This section is for reference - these functions should not be used in PEcAn, as they are redundant with the logger.* functions described above R does provide a basic logging capability using stop, warning and message. These allow to print message (and stop execution in case of stop). However there is not an easy method to redirect the logging information to a file, or turn the logging information on and off. This is where one of the following packages comes into play. The packages themselves are very similar since they try to emulate log4j. Both of the following packages use a hierarchic loggers, meaning that if you change the level of displayed level of logging at one level all levels below it will update their logging. 27.2.1 logging The logging development is done at http://logging.r-forge.r-project.org/ and more information is located at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/logging/index.html . To install use the following command: install.packages(\"logging\", repos=\"http://R-Forge.R-project.org\") This has my preference pure based on documentation. 27.2.2 futile The second logging package is http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/futile.logger/ and is eerily similar to logging (as a matter of fact logging is based on futile). 27.3 Example Usage To be able to use the loggers there needs to be some initialization done. Neither package allows to read it from a configuration file, so we might want to use the pecan.xml file to set it up. The setup will always be somewhat the same: # load library library(logging) logReset() # add handlers, responsible for actually printing/saving the messages addHandler(writeToConsole) addHandler(writeToFile, file=&quot;file.log&quot;) # setup root logger with INFO setLevel(&#39;INFO&#39;) # make all of PEcAn print debug messages setLevel(&#39;DEBUG&#39;, getLogger(&#39;PEcAn&#39;)) # only print info and above for the SQL part of PEcAn setLevel(&#39;INFO&#39;, getLogger(&#39;PEcAn.SQL&#39;)) To now use logging in the code you can use the following code: pl &lt;- getLogger(&#39;PEcAn.MetaAnalysis.function1&#39;) pl$info(&quot;This is an INFO message.&quot;) pl$debug(&quot;The value for x=%d&quot;, x) pl$error(&quot;Something bad happened and I am scared now.&quot;) or loginfo(&quot;This is an INFO message.&quot;, logger=&quot;PEcAn.MetaAnalysis.function1&quot;) logdebug(&quot;The value for x=%d&quot;, x, logger=&quot;PEcAn.MetaAnalysis.function1&quot;) logerror(&quot;Something bad happened and I am scared now.&quot;, logger=&quot;PEcAn.MetaAnalysis.function1&quot;) 27.4 Inputs see Adding-an-Input-Converter 27.4.1 Defining new input formats New formats can be defined on the ‘formats’ page of BETYdb After creating a new format, the contents should be defined by specifying the BETYdb variable name and the name used in the file/ 27.5 Outputs created by model2netcdf functions based on format used by MsTMIP "],

The lnd_in file in the run directory can be modified to change the output file frequency and variables. 28.3 CLM-FATES Prerequisites sudo apt-get upgrade libnetcdf-dev sudo apt-get install subversion sudo apt-get install csh sudo apt-get install cmake sudo ln -s /usr/bin/make /usr/bin/gmake sudo rm /bin/sh sudo ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh wget https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran/archive/v4.4.4.tar.gz cd netcdf-4.4.4 ./configure make sudo make install you might need to mess around with installing netcdf and netcdf-fortran to get a version FATES likes… Get code from Github (currently private) and go to cime/scripts directory git clone git@github.com:NGEET/ed-clm.git cd ed-clm/cime/scripts/ Within CLM-FATES, to be able to build an executable we need to create a reference run. We’ll also use this reference run to grab defaults from, so we’ll be registering the location of both the reference case (location of executable, scripts, etc) and the reference inputs with the PEcAn database. To begin, copy reference run script from pecan cp ~/pecan/models/fates/inst/create_1x1_ref_case.sh . Edit reference case script to set NETCDF_HOME, CROOT (reference run case), DIN_LOC_ROOT (reference run inputs). Also, make sure DIN_LOC_ROOT exists as FATES will not create it itself. Then run the script ./create_1x1_ref_case.sh Be aware that this script WILL ask you for your password on the NCAR server to download the reference case input data (the guest password may work, haven’t tried this). If it gives an error at the pio stage check the log, but the most likely error is it being unable to find a version of netcdf it likes. Once FATES is installed, set the whole reference case directory as the Model path (leave filename blank) and set the whole inputs directory as an Input with format clm_defaults. 28.4 PEcAn Installation PEcAn is the software package that ties all the pieces together. 28.5 Installing PEcAn Download, compile and install PEcAn # download pecan cd git clone https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan.git # compile pecan cd pecan ./scripts/build.sh --dependencies Following will run a small script to setup some hooks to prevent people from using the pecan demo user account to check in any code. # prevent pecan user from checking in code ./scripts/create-hooks.sh 28.6 Installing BETY 28.6.1 Install Postgres See OS-specific instructions for installing Postgres + PostGIS * Ubuntu * OSX * RedHat / CentOS 28.6.2 Install Database + Data note To install BETYdb without PEcAn, first download the load.bety.sh script # install database (code assumes password is bety) sudo -u postgres createuser -d -l -P -R -S bety sudo -u postgres createdb -O bety bety sudo -u postgres ./scripts/load.bety.sh -c YES -u YES -r 0 sudo -u postgres ./scripts/load.bety.sh -r 1 sudo -u postgres ./scripts/load.bety.sh -r 2 # configure for PEcAn web app (change password if needed) cp web/config.example.php web/config.php # add models to database (VM only) ./scripts/add.models.sh # add data to database ./scripts/add.data.sh # create outputs folder mkdir ~/output chmod 777 ~/output 28.6.3 Installing BETYdb Web Application There are two flavors of BETY, PHP and RUBY. The PHP version allows for a minimal interaction with the database while the RUBY version allows for full interaction with the database. 28.6.3.1 PHP version The php version comes with PEcAn and is already configured. 28.6.3.2 RUBY version The RUBY version requires a few extra packages to be installed first. Next we install the web app. # install bety cd git clone https://github.com/PecanProject/bety.git # install gems cd bety sudo gem2.0 install bundler bundle install --without development:test:javascript_testing:debug and configure BETY # create folders for upload folders mkdir paperclip/files paperclip/file_names chmod 777 paperclip/files paperclip/file_names # create folder for log files mkdir log touch log/production.log chmod 0666 log/production.log # fix configuration for vm cp config/additional_environment_vm.rb config/additional_environment.rb chmod go+w public/javascripts/cache/ # setup bety database configuration cat &gt; config/database.yml &lt;&lt; EOF production: adapter: postgis encoding: utf-8 reconnect: false database: bety pool: 5 username: bety password: bety EOF # setup login tokens cat &gt; config/initializers/site_keys.rb &lt;&lt; EOF REST_AUTH_SITE_KEY = &#39;thisisnotasecret&#39; REST_AUTH_DIGEST_STRETCHES = 10 EOF 28.6.4 PEcAn Testrun Do the run, this assumes you have installed the BETY database, sites tar file and sipnet. # create folder cd mkdir testrun.pecan cd testrun.pecan # copy example of pecan workflow and configuration file cp ../pecan/tests/pecan32.sipnet.xml pecan.xml cp ../pecan/scripts/workflow.R workflow.R # exectute workflow rm -rf pecan ./workflow.R pecan.xml NB: pecan.xml is configured for the virtual machine, you will need to change the field from ‘/home/carya/’ to wherever you installed your ‘sites’, usually $HOME "],

["porting-vm-to-aws.html", "34 Porting VM to AWS", " 34 Porting VM to AWS The following are Mike’s rough notes from a first attempt to port the PEcAn VM to the AWS. This was done on a Mac These notes are based on following the instructions here 34.0.1 Convert PEcAn VM AWS allows upload of files as VMDK but the default PEcAn VM is in OVA format If you haven’t done so already, download the PEcAn VM Split the OVA file into OVF and VMDK files tar xf &lt;ovafile&gt; 34.0.2 Set up an account on AWS After you have an account you need to set up a user and save your access key and secret key In my case I created a user named ‘carya’ Note: the key that ended up working had to be made at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#security_credential, not the link above. 34.0.3 Install EC2 command line tools wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/ec2-api-tools.zip sudo mkdir /usr/local/ec2 sudo unzip ec2-api-tools.zip -d /usr/local/ec2 If need be, download and install JDK export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home) export EC2_HOME=/usr/local/ec2/ec2-api-tools-&lt;version&gt; export PATH=$PATH:$EC2_HOME/bin Then set your user credentials as environment variables: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx export AWS_SECRET_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Note: you may want to add all the variables set in the above EXPORT commands above into your .bashrc or equivalent. 34.0.4 Create an AWS S3 ‘bucket’ to upload VM to Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3 and click “Create Bucket” In my case I named the bucket ‘pecan’ 34.0.5 Upload In the code below, make sure to change the PEcAn version, the name of the bucket, and the name of the region. Make sure that the architecture matches the version of PEcAn you downloaded (i386 for 32 bit, x86_64 for 64 bit). Also, you may want to choose a considerably larger instance type. The one chosen below is that corresponding to the AWS Free Tier ec2-import-instance PEcAn32bit_1.2.6-disk1.vmdk --instance-type t2.micro --format VMDK --architecture i386 --platform Linux --bucket pecan --region us-east-1 --owner-akid $AWS_ACCESS_KEY --owner-sak $AWS_SECRET_KEY Make sure to note the ID of the image since you’ll need it to check the VM status. Once the image is uploaded it will take a while (typically about an hour) for Amazon to convert the image to one it can run. You can check on this progress by running ec2-describe-conversion-tasks &lt;image.ID&gt; 34.0.6 Configuring the VM On the EC2 management webpage, https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2, if you select Instances on the left hand side (LHS) you should be able to see your new PEcAn image as an option under Launch Instance. Before launching, you will want to update the firewall to open up additional ports that PEcAn needs – specifically port 80 for the webpage. Port 22 (ssh/sftp) should be open by default. Under “Security Groups” select “Inbound” then “Edit” and then add “HTTP”. Select “Elastic IPs” on the LHS, and “Allocate New Address” in order to create a public IP for your VM. Next, select “Network Interfaces” on the LHS and then under Actions select “Associate Addresses” then choose the Elastic IP you just created. See also http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/GettingStartedGuide/GetStarted.html 34.0.7 Set up multiple instances (optional) For info on setting up multiple instances with load balancing see: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/gs-ec2VPC.html Select “Load Balancers” on the LHS, click on “Create Load Balancer”, follow Wizard keeping defaults. To be able to launch multiple VMs: Under “Instances” convert VM to an Image. When done, select Launch, enable multiple instances, and associate with the previous security group. Once running, go back to “Load Balancers” and add the instances to the load balancer. Each instance can be accessed individually by it’s own public IP, but external users should access the system more generally via the Load Balancers DNS. 34.0.8 Booting the VM Return to “Instances” using the menu on the LHS. To boot the VM select “Actions” then “Instance State” then “Start”.

NOTE: Pretty much every step here requires root access. 35.1 Install the Shiny R package and Shiny server The shiny R package can be installed directly in R via install.packages(&quot;shiny&quot;). Download and install the Shiny server binary (link). 35.2 CentOS wget https://download3.rstudio.org/centos5.9/x86_64/shiny-server-1.4.2.786-rh5-x86_64.rpm sudo yum install --nogpgcheck shiny-server-1.4.2.786-rh5-x86_64.rpm 35.3 Ubuntu NOTE: The additional gdebi dependence may be optional and dpkg may work just fine, but I haven’t tested this out. $ sudo apt-get install gdebi-core $ wget https://download3.rstudio.org/ubuntu-12.04/x86_64/shiny-server-1.4.2.786-amd64.deb $ sudo gdebi shiny-server-1.4.2.786-amd64.deb 35.4 Modify the shiny configuration file The Shiny configuration file is located in /etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf. Comment out the entire file and add the following, replacing &lt;username&gt; with your user name and &lt;location&gt; with the URL location you want for your app. This will allow you to run Shiny apps from your web browser at https://your.server.edu/shiny/your-location run as shiny; server { listen 3838; location /&lt;location&gt;/ { run as &lt;username&gt;; site_dir /path/to/your/shiny/app; log_dir /var/log/shiny-server; directory_index on; } } For example, my configuration on the old test-pecan looks like this. run as shiny; server { listen 3838; location /ashiklom/ { run as ashiklom; site_dir /home/ashiklom/fs-data/pecan/shiny/; log_dir /var/log/shiny-server; directory_index on; } } …and I can access my Shiny apps at, for instance, https://test-pecan.bu.edu/shiny/ashiklom/workflowPlots. You can add as many location &lt;loc&gt; { ... } fields as you would like. run as shiny; server { listen 3838; location /ashiklom/ { ... } location /bety/ { ... } } 35.5 Set the httpd proxy Create a file /etc/httpd/conf.d/shiny.conf containing the following proxy settings: ProxyPass /shiny/ http://localhost:3838/ ProxyPassReverse /shiny/ http://localhost:3838/ RedirectMatch permanent ^/shiny$ /shiny/ 35.6 Create a symbolic link to the shiny server service sudo ln -s /opt/shiny-server/config/init.d/redhat/shiny-server /etc/init.d 35.7 Start the shiny server and restart httpd sudo service shiny-server stop sudo service shiny-server start sudo service httpd restart You can check that Shiny is running with service shiny-server status. 35.8 Troubleshooting Refer to the log files for shiny (/var/log/shiny-server.log) and httpd (/var/log/httpd/error-log). 35.9 Further reading Shiny server configuration reference "],
